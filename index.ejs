<h1>I'm Jackson</h1>
<p>
  A Data Scientist, Sales Engineer, and Web Developer. I created the FIFA 2022 World Cup Data Analytics App. I'm a real human who loves football and any international sports tournaments. I also enjoy long walks—every programmer needs a break from the screen sometimes!

<p>
  I started coding at 20, aiming to use tech to solve real-life challenges in Rwanda. I'm still on that journey, learning and building web applications along the way.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What's my top skill?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Eating bread! I'm the Bread King! Day or night, I'm always ready for some bread. Whole grain and sprouted grain are my favorites. Just call me the Bread Champion! 🍞👑</p>
